1. Since github has a restriction on 10MB upload I had to seperate all songs into different folders to get them below 10MB. Now you will need to
	Take all the songs from each folder and stick into 1 new folder that you create and name it music.
	(if you name the folder anything else other than music and do not put all the music files into the new folder it will throw errors)

2. Copy the custom folder into your Mission.Map.pbo 
	(If you already have a custom folder than copy the Critos_Loudspeaker folder into your custom folder)
	
3. copy the CfgSounds code provided in the description.ext into the bottom of your description.ext
	(If you already have a class CfgSounds section than pate in the code below to your CfgSounds)
	
	#include "custom\Critos_LoudSpeaker\PlayList.hpp"
	
4. Copy the contents of initServer into the bottom of your initServer	

This spawns a loudspeaker at the Altis Terminal trader that plays music up to 350 meters. Sound is 3D so it is louder outside buildings and gets
harder to hear farther away you move from the speaker.

The location of the loudspeaker 
can be changed in the LoudSpeaker.sqf by using editor to get all the necessary cordinates and plugging them into the correct locations.

If you understand code you can add your own sound files by adding necessary information into the playList.hpp and LoudSpeaker.sqf
then adding in .ogg sound into music folder.

Songs are chosen randomly but the same song is heard by everyone in the area. If you join and do not hear a song playing you will have to wait
about 5 minutes before you hear the music becuase the current song was remote executed before you joined and since you were not on you cant hear it
but when the next song starts you will hear it because you were connected when server remote executed it for you to hear. this applies also if you 
dissconnect and rejoing you will have to wait for next song to start hearing the music.
